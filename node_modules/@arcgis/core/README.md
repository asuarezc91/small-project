# @arcgis/core (beta)

[ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) ES modules.

These ES modules are in beta and are not intended for use in production applications.

## Features

You can install this minified, unbuilt version of the API via [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and then use the modules directly in a framework such as [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) or [Angular](https://cli.angular.io/). Or, you can also create your own custom builds with [Webpack](https://webpackjs.org) or [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).

Sample applications can be found [here](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/esm-samples).

## Instructions

```
npm install @arcgis/core
```

The styles, images, fonts, and localization files are located in the `@arcgis/core/assets` folder and will need to be copied to your build folder. There are various ways to accomplish this depending on your build tooling, below are several code snippets demonstrating the concept. 

For React, use `ncp` to copy the asset files to the build directory:

```json
# package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ncp ./node_modules/@arcgis/core/assets ./public/assets && react-scripts start",
    "build": "ncp ./node_modules/@arcgis/core/assets ./public/assets && react-scripts build",
  }
}
```

For Angular, configure copying asset files using the `architect/build/options/assets` section of `angular.json`

```json
# angular.json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "glob": "**/*",
      "input": "node_modules/@arcgis/core/assets",
      "output": "/assets/"
    }
  ]
}
```

For other installations, consider using this package script as a starting point:

```json
# package.json
{
  "script": {
    "copy": "cp -R ./node_modules/@arcgis/core/assets ./dist/assets"
  }
}
```

Windows users can use [`xcopy`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/xcopy) or [`ncp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ncp) for any platform.
